# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Master text processing in Python by learning to manipulate strings, read and write files, and perform advanced text operations. You will build practical skills in working with file I/O and implementing text analysis and transformation techniques.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build a Text File Analyzer

#### Description
Create a program that reads a text file and provides comprehensive analysis of its contents, including word frequency, character counts, and text statistics.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read a text file from disk and handle file I/O errors gracefully
- Count the total number of words, characters, and lines in the file
- Identify and display the most frequently occurring words (excluding common stop words like "the", "a", "is")
- Calculate average word length and sentence statistics
- Save the analysis results to a new output file in a formatted, readable way
- Support both lowercase and uppercase characters uniformly
- Handle edge cases such as punctuation and special characters
- Provide clear output showing all analyzed metrics

### 🛠️ Create a Text Transformation Utility

#### Description
Develop a utility program that performs various text transformations and manipulations on input files, including cleaning, formatting, and pattern-based modifications.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Implement a function to clean text (remove extra whitespace, normalize line endings)
- Implement a function to convert between different text cases (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
- Implement a find-and-replace feature that supports pattern matching or simple string replacement
- Read input from a file, apply the selected transformation, and write results to a new file
- Preserve the original file while creating a new modified version
- Handle multiple transformations in sequence
- Validate user input and provide informative error messages
- Include command-line arguments or menu options to select transformation types
